## Data Cleaning üßπ
- Create new columns for Year, Month, and Date from dayhours in the dataset.
- Identify and address outliers, handle null values, and remove irrelevant data points.
- Remove rows with $ values in the year_built column and NaN values in living and lot measures.
- Address values like 0.5 and 0.7 for room_bath using appropriate treatment.
- Handle null and $ values in the ceil or number of floors in a house column, replacing them with 2.
- Convert Zipcode to City Name for better interpretability.
- Create scaled data with encoded city values for modeling.

## Data Analysis üìä
