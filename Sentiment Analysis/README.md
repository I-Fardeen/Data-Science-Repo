## 🌟 Welcome to the Project!
Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis** project! 🎉 In this project, we embark on a journey through the exciting world of natural language processing and machine learning. Get ready to learn about text cleaning, model building, and the magic of turning text data into insightful predictions.

## 📋 Project Overview

In this project, we'll take you through the entire process of building a text classification model. Here's a glimpse of what's in store:
- **Start**: Introduction to the project's objectives and the motivation behind text classification.
- **Text Cleaning**: Dive into the details of cleaning and preprocessing textual data, including lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, handling special characters, stopwords removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Model Building**: Get an overview of how we construct a text classification model, including converting text data to numerical format using CountVectorizer, splitting the dataset for training and testing, and implementing algorithms like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

Let's jump right in and explore the steps that lead us to an effective text classification model! 📚
