## 1. Scraping the Data from Web using Selenium 🕷️

In this section, we'll use Selenium to scrape movie reviews from the web.

## 2. Reading the Data and Initial Checks 📖🔍

We'll read and explore the scraped data to understand its structure.

## 3. Data Cleaning 🧹

Cleaning the data involves handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

## 4. Removing Symbols using Regex ✂️

We'll use regular expressions to clean the text data by removing unwanted symbols.

## 5. Removing Stopwords and Converting to Lowercase 🚫🔡

Stopwords will be removed, and text will be converted to lowercase for better analysis.

## 6. Sentiment Analysis on Each Review using VADER 😄🙁

We'll perform sentiment analysis on the reviews using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.

## 7. Plotting the Sentiments 📈📉

Visualize the sentiment scores to understand the overall sentiment distribution.

## 8. Stemming 🌱

Stemming will be applied to reduce words to their root forms.

## 9. Lemmatization 📚

Lemmatization is used to reduce words to their base or dictionary form.

## 10. Count Vectorization using Tf-Idf Vectorizer 📊

We'll use the Tf-Idf Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors.

## 11. Model Building: Latent Dirichlet Allocation 🧠

We'll build a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to uncover topics in the reviews.

## 12. Model Evaluation 📊

Evaluate the LDA model and measure its performance.

Feel free to explore each section for detailed information on the project tasks and analysis steps.

Happy analyzing! 🎬📊
