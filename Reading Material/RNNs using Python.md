## 1. Introduction to RNNs 📈

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks designed for sequence data. They can model temporal dependencies and are widely used in applications like text generation, time series prediction, and more.

## 2. Installing Libraries 📦

Install necessary libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch:

```python
# For TensorFlow
pip install tensorflow

# For PyTorch
pip install torch
```

## 3. Creating an RNN 🧠

Create a basic RNN model using TensorFlow or PyTorch:

```python
# TensorFlow example
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
```

## 4. Vanishing Gradient Problem 📉

Understand and address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs.

## 5. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) 📚

Explore the LSTM architecture for improved modeling of long-term dependencies:

```python
# LSTM in TensorFlow
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
```

## 6. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) 🏗️

Discover the GRU architecture as a simplified alternative to LSTM:

```python
# GRU in PyTorch
import torch
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.GRU(64, return_sequences=True),
    torch.nn.Linear(1)
)
```

## 7. Text Generation with RNN 📝

Generate text using an RNN model:

```python
# Text generation with LSTM
# Implement using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch
```

## 8. Time Series Prediction ⏰

Predict future values in time series data:

```python
# Time series prediction with RNN
# Implement using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch
```

## 9. Stock Price Prediction 📈

Use RNNs for stock price prediction:

```python
# Stock price prediction with RNN
# Implement using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch
```
