# PyCaret Cheat Sheet 📝🚀

Made with :heart: by Fardeen Ahmad Khan

Welcome to the PyCaret cheat sheet! PyCaret is an open-source Python library that automates machine learning workflows, making it easier for you to train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models. Let's explore PyCaret with some code examples!

## Installation

You can install PyCaret using pip:

```bash
pip install pycaret
```

## Importing PyCaret

Import PyCaret like this:

```python
from pycaret.classification import *
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Setting up Your Environment

Initialize your PyCaret environment:

```python
exp1 = setup(data, target='target_column', session_id=123)
```

### 2. Compare Models

Automatically compare and evaluate machine learning models:

```python
best_model = compare_models()
```

### 3. Create a Model

Create a specific machine learning model:

```python
model = create_model('decision_tree')
```

### 4. Tune Model Hyperparameters

Tune hyperparameters of a model:

```python
tuned_model = tune_model(model)
```

### 5. Plot Model Performance

Visualize model performance:

```python
plot_model(model, plot='confusion_matrix')
```

## Advanced Usage

### 6. Model Interpretation

Interpret model results with SHAP values:

```python
interpret_model(model)
```

### 7. Model Deployment

Deploy models to a cloud platform:

```python
deploy_model(model, model_name='my_model', platform='aws', authentication={'bucket': 's3-bucket'})
```

### 8. Anomaly Detection

Use PyCaret for anomaly detection:

```python
anom_model = create_model('iforest', fraction=0.1)
```
