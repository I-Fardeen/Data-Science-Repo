# Prophet in Python Cheat Sheet ðŸ“ˆðŸ”®

Made with :heart: by **Fardeen Ahmad Khan**

Welcome to the Prophet cheat sheet! Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook. It is designed for forecasting time series data, making it a valuable tool for analysts and data scientists. Let's dive into Prophet with some code examples.

## Installation

You can install Prophet using pip:

```bash
pip install pystan==2.19.1.1
pip install fbprophet
```

## Importing Prophet

To start using Prophet, import it as follows:

```python
from fbprophet import Prophet
```

## Basic Usage

Prophet expects a DataFrame with two columns: `ds` (the date or time) and `y` (the value you want to forecast). Here's how to use it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
  'ds': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03'],
  'y': [10, 15, 12]
})

# Initialize the model
model = Prophet()

# Fit the model to your data
model.fit(df)

# Create a future DataFrame
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)

# Make predictions
forecast = model.predict(future)

# Plot the forecast
fig = model.plot(forecast)
```

## Custom Seasonality

You can add custom seasonalities to your model. For example, to add daily seasonality:

```python
model.add_seasonality(
    name='daily',
    period=1,
    fourier_order=3
)
```
