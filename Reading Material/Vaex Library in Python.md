# Vaex in Python Cheat Sheet 🐍🚀

Welcome to the Vaex cheat sheet! Vaex is a Python library for lazy, out-of-core DataFrames. It's designed for fast, memory-efficient data manipulation and exploration. Let's explore some key concepts and code examples.

## Installation

You can install Vaex using pip:

```bash
pip install vaex
```

## Basic Usage

### Importing Vaex

To get started with Vaex, import the library:

```python
import vaex
```

### Reading Data

Vaex supports various file formats like CSV, Parquet, and HDF5. You can read data as a Vaex DataFrame.

```python
# Read a CSV file
df = vaex.from_csv('data.csv', convert=True, chunk_size=5_000_000)
```

### Lazy Operations

Vaex performs lazy operations by default, so it doesn't load the entire dataset into memory.

```python
# Filter data lazily
df_filtered = df[df['column'] > 10]

# Compute statistics lazily
mean_value = df['column'].mean()
```

### Aggregations

Vaex allows for efficient aggregation operations:

```python
# Grouping and aggregating
agg_df = df.groupby(df['category'], agg=vaex.agg.mean(df['value']))
```

### Machine Learning

You can use Vaex for machine learning tasks as well. It integrates seamlessly with libraries like Scikit-Learn.

```python
from vaex.ml.sklearn import Predictor

# Create a Scikit-Learn model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
predictor = Predictor(model, features=['feature1', 'feature2'], target='target')
predictor.fit(df_filtered)
```

## Advanced Concepts

- **Virtual Columns**: Vaex supports virtual columns, which are computed on-the-fly without using memory.

- **Plotting**: Vaex integrates with Matplotlib for creating interactive, high-performance plots.

- **Progressive Indexing**: Vaex provides a way to index your data progressively, making it suitable for large datasets.
