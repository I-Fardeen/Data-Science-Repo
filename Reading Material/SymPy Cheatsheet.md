## 1. Introduction to SymPy 📝

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It allows you to perform symbolic calculations, solve equations, differentiate and integrate functions, and work with matrices.

## 2. Installing SymPy 📦

Install SymPy using pip:

```python
pip install sympy
```

## 3. Symbolic Expressions ✏️

Create and manipulate symbolic expressions:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define symbols
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# Create symbolic expressions
expr1 = x**2 + 2*x + 1
expr2 = sp.sin(x) + sp.cos(x)
```

## 4. Solving Equations 🧮

Solve algebraic and transcendental equations:

```python
# Solve algebraic equations
solution = sp.solve(expr1, x)

# Solve transcendental equations
solution2 = sp.solve(sp.sin(x) - sp.cos(x), x)
```

## 5. Calculus 📚

Perform calculus operations:

```python
# Differentiate expressions
derivative = sp.diff(expr1, x)

# Integrate expressions
integral = sp.integrate(expr1, x)
```

## 6. Linear Algebra ⚙️

Work with matrices and linear algebra:

```python
# Create matrices
A = sp.Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = sp.Matrix([[0, 1], [1, 0]])

# Matrix operations
product = A * B
determinant = A.det()
```

## 7. Differential Equations 📖

Solve differential equations:

```python
# Define a differential equation
f = sp.Function('f')
diff_eq = sp.Eq(f(x).diff(x, x) - 2*f(x), sp.sin(x))

# Solve the differential equation
sol = sp.dsolve(diff_eq)
```

## 8. Plotting with SymPy 📊

Visualize symbolic expressions:

```python
# Plot a symbolic expression
sp.plot(expr1, (x, -5, 5))
```

## 9. Error Handling 🐞

Handle exceptions that may occur during SymPy calculations:

```python
try:
    # SymPy code here
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## 10. Resources 📚
