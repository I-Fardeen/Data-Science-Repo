# Yellowbrick in Python Cheat Sheet üêçüìä

Welcome to the Yellowbrick cheat sheet! Yellowbrick is a fantastic Python library for visualizing machine learning models. This cheat sheet will introduce you to the key concepts and provide code examples to help you visualize your models effectively.

## Installation

You can install Yellowbrick using pip:

```bash
pip install yellowbrick
```

## Code Examples

### Visualizer Gallery

Yellowbrick provides a wide range of visualizers to help you understand your models. Below are a few examples:

1. **Classification Report**:

   Visualize the classification report for a classifier.

   ```python
   from yellowbrick.classifier import ClassificationReport

   visualizer = ClassificationReport(model)
   visualizer.fit(X_train, y_train)
   visualizer.score(X_test, y_test)
   visualizer.show()
   ```

2. **Confusion Matrix**:

   Visualize the confusion matrix for a classifier.

   ```python
   from yellowbrick.classifier import ConfusionMatrix

   visualizer = ConfusionMatrix(model)
   visualizer.fit(X_train, y_train)
   visualizer.score(X_test, y_test)
   visualizer.show()
   ```

3. **Elbow Method for K-Means**:

   Find the optimal number of clusters for a K-Means model.

   ```python
   from yellowbrick.cluster import KElbowVisualizer

   visualizer = KElbowVisualizer(model, k=(2, 12))
   visualizer.fit(X)
   visualizer.show()
   ```

4. **Regression Residuals**:

   Visualize the residuals of a regression model.

   ```python
   from yellowbrick.regressor import ResidualsPlot

   visualizer = ResidualsPlot(model)
   visualizer.fit(X_train, y_train)
   visualizer.score(X_test, y_test)
   visualizer.show()
   ```

### Feature Visualization

Yellowbrick also offers feature visualization tools like `FeatureImportances` and `Rank1D`. These visualizers help you understand feature importance and distributions.

### Model Selection Visualization

When it comes to model selection, Yellowbrick provides visualizers for cross-validated scores, validation curves, and more.

### Text Visualization

Visualize text data with tools like `UMAPText`, `TSNE`, and `TokenFreqDist`.

Yellowbrick is a powerful library for model visualization and selection in Python. This cheat sheet provides an overview of essential Yellowbrick visualizers and code examples to get you started.
