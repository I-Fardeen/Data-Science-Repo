## 1. What is BioPython? 🧬

BioPython is an open-source Python library designed for bioinformatics. It offers tools and modules for working with biological data, including sequences, file formats, and computational biology algorithms.

## 2. Installing BioPython 🚀

Install BioPython using pip:

```python
pip install biopython
```

## 3. Working with Sequences 🧾

BioPython provides tools to work with biological sequences:

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq

my_seq = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
```

## 4. Parsing File Formats 📂

Easily parse common biological file formats:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

record = SeqIO.read("sequence.fasta", "fasta")
```

## 5. Sequence Manipulation 🔬

Perform various operations on sequences:

```python
complement = my_seq.complement()
transcription = my_seq.transcribe()
translation = my_seq.translate()
```

## 6. BLAST Search 🔍

Perform BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches:

```python
from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW

result_handle = NCBIWWW.qblast("blastn", "nt", my_seq)
```

## 7. Phylogenetic Trees 🌳

Create and manipulate phylogenetic trees:

```python
from Bio import Phylo

tree = Phylo.read("tree.xml", "phyloxml")
```

## 8. Resources 📚
