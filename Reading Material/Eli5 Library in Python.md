# Eli5 in Python Cheat Sheet 🧐📊

Made with :heart: by **Fardeen Ahmad Khan**

Welcome to the Eli5 cheat sheet! Eli5 is a Python library that helps you visualize and debug machine learning models. It provides insights into model predictions and feature importance. Let's explore some key concepts and code examples for Eli5.

## Installation

You can install Eli5 using pip:

```bash
pip install eli5
```

## Importing Eli5

To get started with Eli5, import the library:

```python
import eli5
```

## Visualizing Model Predictions

Eli5 can help you understand and visualize your model's predictions. For example, if you have a scikit-learn model `clf`, you can use Eli5 to visualize its predictions for a specific instance:

```python
eli5.show_prediction(clf, data_point)
```

This will provide insights into why the model made a particular prediction.

## Feature Importance

Eli5 is also excellent for visualizing feature importance. For example, if you want to see the feature importances of a model, you can use:

```python
eli5.show_weights(clf, feature_names=feature_names)
```

This will display the importance of each feature in the model's decision-making process.

## Debugging Models

Eli5 is a powerful tool for debugging models. You can identify issues such as underfitting or overfitting by inspecting individual predictions.
