### 22. Describe the concept of imbalanced datasets in machine learning.
**Answer**: Imbalanced datasets have an unequal distribution of classes, where one class significantly outnumbers the others, which can lead to biased models. Techniques like resampling and using different evaluation metrics are often used to address this issue.

### 23. What is the purpose of cross-validation in model evaluation?
**Answer**: Cross-validation is used to estimate a model's performance by dividing the data into subsets for training and testing. It helps assess how well a model generalizes to new data.

### 24. Explain the terms precision and recall in classification.
**Answer**: Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions, while recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives. They are often used together to evaluate classification models.

### 25. What is the role of gradient descent in machine learning?
**Answer**: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function and update model parameters iteratively to find the optimal values.

### 26. Describe the bias-variance trade-off in the context of model selection.
**Answer**: The bias-variance trade-off suggests that as a model's complexity increases, bias decreases but variance increases. Finding the right balance is crucial to avoid overfitting or underfitting.

### 27. Explain the concept of feature scaling in machine learning.
**Answer**: Feature scaling standardizes or normalizes feature values to a common scale, preventing features with large ranges from dominating the learning process.

### 28. What is the purpose of the term "One-Hot Encoding" in data preprocessing?
**Answer**: One-Hot Encoding converts categorical variables into a binary matrix, representing each category as a separate column with binary values (0 or 1).

### 29. Describe the differences between L1 and L2 regularization in linear models.
**Answer**: L1 regularization (Lasso) adds the absolute values of coefficients as a penalty term, leading to feature selection. L2 regularization (Ridge) adds the square of coefficients as a penalty term, reducing the magnitude of all coefficients.

### 30. Explain the use of ROC-AUC in model evaluation.
**Answer**: ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) is a metric used to assess a model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. A higher AUC indicates better model performance.

### 31. What is a confusion matrix in the context of classification?
**Answer**: A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

### 32. Explain the purpose of stratified sampling in data sampling techniques.
**Answer**: Stratified sampling ensures that the proportion of each class in a sample is the same as the proportion in the entire dataset, helping to maintain representativeness.

### 33. Describe the bias-variance trade-off in the context of model selection.
**Answer**: The bias-variance trade-off suggests that as a model's complexity increases, bias decreases but variance increases. Finding the right balance is crucial to avoid overfitting or underfitting.

### 45. What is the difference between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent?
**Answer**: Batch gradient descent computes the gradient of the cost function using the entire training dataset, while stochastic gradient descent computes it using one randomly selected sample at a time. Stochastic gradient descent is faster but more noisy.

### 46. Explain the concept of the "bias" in machine learning models.
**Answer**: Bias refers to a model's systematic error, where it consistently predicts values that are different from the true values.

### 47. What is an ROC curve, and how is it used in model evaluation?
**Answer**: An ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of a classification model's performance by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various thresholds. It helps determine the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

### 48. Describe the purpose of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence) in information theory.
**Answer**: KL Divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions. It is used in information theory and machine learning to assess how one distribution diverges from another.
