## 1. What is Numba? 🔍

Numba is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for Python that translates Python functions to optimized machine code, speeding up numerical and scientific computations.

## 2. Installing Numba 📦

Install Numba using pip:

```python
pip install numba
```

## 3. Numba Basics 🚀

Decorate Python functions with `@jit` to compile them with Numba:

```python
from numba import jit

@jit
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

## 4. Numba with NumPy 📊

Boost NumPy operations with Numba for significant speed improvements:

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import vectorize

@vectorize
def fast_multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
```

## 5. Parallelization with Numba 🚀

Parallelize your code easily with Numba's `prange`:

```python
from numba import prange

@jit(nogil=True)
def parallel_example(arr):
    for i in prange(len(arr)):
        arr[i] = expensive_function(arr[i])
```

## 6. Just-In-Time Compilation ⚙️

Numba uses Just-In-Time compilation to optimize Python code dynamically.

## 7. Numba for GPU 🌌

Numba supports GPU acceleration for numerical computing:

```python
from numba import cuda

@cuda.jit
def gpu_add(a, b, result):
    result[0] = a + b
```

## 8. Optimizing Functions with Numba 📈

Optimize your existing functions for better performance:

```python
@jit
def optimized_function(data):
    # Optimize your Python function with Numba
```

## 9. Memory Management 🧠

Numba provides control over memory management for efficient data handling.
