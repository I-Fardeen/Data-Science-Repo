# HyperOpt in Python Cheat Sheet üßØüêç

Welcome to the HyperOpt cheat sheet! HyperOpt is a Python library for hyperparameter optimization. It provides an efficient and scalable way to search for the best hyperparameters for your machine learning models. Let's dive into HyperOpt with code examples.

## Installation

You can install HyperOpt using pip:

```bash
pip install hyperopt
```

## Importing HyperOpt

To start using HyperOpt, import it:

```python
from hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp
```

## Creating an Objective Function

Define an objective function that returns the value to optimize. Here's a simple example:

```python
def objective(params):
    return params['x']**2
```

## Specifying the Search Space

Define the search space for hyperparameters. Use `hp` for different types like `hp.choice` and `hp.uniform`. Here's an example:

```python
space = {
    'x': hp.uniform('x', -10, 10)
}
```

## Running Hyperparameter Optimization

Run the optimization process using the objective function and the search space:

```python
best = fmin(fn=objective, space=space, algo=tpe.suggest, max_evals=100)
```

## Accessing the Best Hyperparameters

You can access the best hyperparameters found by HyperOpt:

```python
print("Best Hyperparameters:")
print(best)
```

## Advanced Features

HyperOpt provides advanced features like saving and loading trials and parallel optimization.
