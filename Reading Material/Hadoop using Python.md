Welcome to the world of Hadoop and Python! This cheat sheet is your guide to harnessing the power of Hadoop for big data processing using Python. Don't forget to follow the author, [Fardeen Ahmad Khan](https://github.com/I-Fardeen), for more Hadoop insights and updates! 🙌

🚀 **Getting Started with Hadoop and Python**:
To begin your journey with Hadoop and Python, make sure you have Hadoop installed and configured on your system.

💼 **Hadoop File System (HDFS)**:
Hadoop's distributed file system is essential. Interact with HDFS using Python libraries like `hdfs`.

```python
from hdfs import InsecureClient

# Create an HDFS client
client = InsecureClient('http://localhost:9870', user='your_username')
```

📁 **HDFS Operations**:
Perform common HDFS operations using Python, such as uploading, downloading, and listing files.

```python
# Upload a local file to HDFS
client.upload('/user/your_username/', 'local_file.txt')

# Download a file from HDFS
client.download('/user/your_username/local_file.txt', '/local/path/')

# List files in a directory
file_list = client.list('/user/your_username/')
```

🔍 **MapReduce with Python**:
Develop MapReduce applications in Python with libraries like `mrjob`.

```python
from mrjob.job import MRJob

class MyMapReduceJob(MRJob):

    def mapper(self, _, line):
        # Map function logic here

    def reducer(self, key, values):
        # Reduce function logic here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyMapReduceJob.run()
```

📊 **Hive Integration**:
Integrate Hive with Python to execute Hive queries and analyze data.

```python
from pyhive import hive

# Connect to Hive
connection = hive.connect(host='localhost', port=10000, username='your_username')
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute Hive queries
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM your_table')
```

🔗 **Pig Scripting**:
Utilize Python to run Pig scripts for data transformations in Hadoop.

```python
import subprocess

# Run Pig script
subprocess.call(['pig', '-x', 'local', 'your_script.pig'])
```

🛠️ **Advanced Hadoop Operations**:
Explore advanced Hadoop operations, such as YARN resource management and custom Hadoop job configurations using Python.

Now, you're equipped to leverage the combined power of Hadoop and Python for your big data projects. Happy Hadooping! 🐘🐍
