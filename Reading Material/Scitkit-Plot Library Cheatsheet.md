# Scikit-Plot in Python Cheat Sheet ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the Scikit-Plot cheat sheet! Scikit-Plot is a Python library that provides easy-to-use functions for visualizing machine learning models. It's designed to work seamlessly with scikit-learn models. Let's explore some essential concepts and code examples for Scikit-Plot.

## Installation

You can install Scikit-Plot using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-plot
```

## Importing Scikit-Plot

To get started with Scikit-Plot, import the library and matplotlib for plotting:

```python
import scikitplot as skplt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Visualizing Classification Reports

Scikit-Plot makes it easy to visualize classification reports. After training a classification model with scikit-learn, you can generate a classification report plot:

```python
skplt.metrics.plot_classification_report(y_true, y_pred)
plt.show()
```

This provides a visual summary of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## ROC Curves

You can plot ROC curves to assess the performance of binary classifiers:

```python
skplt.metrics.plot_roc(y_true, y_probas)
plt.show()
```

This visualization is especially useful for understanding how well a binary classifier separates classes.

## Confusion Matrix

Scikit-Plot simplifies the creation of confusion matrix plots:

```python
skplt.metrics.plot_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, normalize=True)
plt.show()
```

These plots help you see where your model is making errors and can be particularly helpful for multi-class classification.

## Calibration Curve

To assess the calibration of your classifier, you can create a calibration curve:

```python
skplt.metrics.plot_calibration_curve(y_true, probas_list, clf_names)
plt.show()
```

This visualization shows how well your classifier's predicted probabilities align with actual outcomes.
