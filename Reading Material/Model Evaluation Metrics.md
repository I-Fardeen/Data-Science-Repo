| Metric                           | Description                                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**                     | A measure of the proportion of correct predictions. |
| **AUC-ROC**                      | The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. |
| **Confusion Matrix**             | A table used to describe the performance of a classification model. |
| **F1-Score**                     | The harmonic mean of precision and recall. |
| **Log Loss (Logarithmic Loss)**  | Measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction output is a probability value between 0 and 1. |
| **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**    | The average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual values. Used in regression problems. |
| **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**     | The average of the squared differences between predictions and actual values. Used in regression problems. |
| **Precision**                    | The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions. |
| **Recall**                       | The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. |
| **R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination)** | Measures the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by independent variables. Used in regression problems. |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** | The square root of the average of the squared differences between predictions and actual values. Used in regression problems. |
| **Sensitivity**                  | A synonym for Recall. |
| **Specificity**                  | The ratio of true negative predictions to the total actual negatives. |
| **Silhouette Score**             | Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Used in clustering problems. |
| **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**    | Measures the similarity between true labels and predicted labels. Used in clustering problems. |
| **Calinski-Harabasz Index (Variance Ratio Criterion)** | Measures the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. Used in clustering problems. |
| **Davies-Bouldin Index**         | Measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster. Used in clustering problems. |
| **Jaccard Index**                | Measures the similarity between two sets. Used in classification and clustering problems. |

Explore these metrics to evaluate your machine learning models effectively across various types of data science problems. Happy modeling! üöÄüìâ
