- **Time Series Conversion**: Convert the dataset into a time series format to enable easy manipulation and analysis.
- **Trend and Seasonality Analysis**: Dive into identifying trends, seasonality patterns, and level changes within the time series data.
- **Decomposition**: Deconstruct the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components for a deeper understanding.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Apply Exponential Smoothing techniques and a Seasonal ARIMA model to forecast future prices.
- **Model Performance**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and plots.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Determine optimal parameters using ACF and PACF plots for the Seasonal ARIMA model.
- **Stationarity Testing**: Perform the Dickey Fuller test to assess stationarity, a crucial aspect of time series modeling.

Join us on this exciting journey as we uncover patterns, model trends, and harness the power of time series analysis to predict open and close prices! 🚀

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis 📊
Perform an initial exploratory analysis of the time series data to gain insights into the behavior of open and close prices over time.

## 2. Time Series Conversion ⏳
Convert the dataset into a time series format, enabling easy manipulation and analysis of temporal patterns.

## 3. Initial Analysis 📈
Analyze the time series data for trends and seasonality. Identify the presence of a downward trend and seasonality patterns. Also, observe how the level of the data changes with time.

## 4. Decomposition 🔍
Decompose the time series data into its trend, seasonal, and residual components to better understand the underlying patterns.

## 5. Train-Test Split 🚂
Divide the time series data into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

## 6. Exponential Smoothing with Custom Parameters 📈
Apply exponential smoothing techniques to the time series data with custom parameters to capture and model the trends and seasonality.

## 7. Model Performance 🏆
Evaluate the performance of the exponential smoothing model on the test dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## 8. Seasonal ARIMA Model 🔄
Implement a Seasonal ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to capture the complex patterns of the time series data.

## 9. Dickey Fuller Test for Stationarity 📏
Perform the Dickey Fuller test to check for the stationarity of the time series data, a prerequisite for time series modeling.

## 10. Detrending and Removing Seasonality 🌱
Apply first-order differencing to detrend the time series data and seasonal differencing to remove the seasonality component.

## 11. Optimal P, D, Q Values using PACF and ACF Plots 📉
Utilize Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF) and AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) plots to identify the optimal values of the parameters P, D, and Q for the Seasonal ARIMA model.

## 12. Model Building and Parameter Tuning 🛠️
Build the Seasonal ARIMA model with the determined optimal parameters. Fine-tune the model parameters for optimal performance.
