# Project: Time Series Analysis - Forecasting Open vs. Close Prices

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform an initial exploratory analysis of the time series data to gain insights into the behavior of open and close prices over time.

## 2. Time Series Conversion
Convert the dataset into a time series format, enabling easy manipulation and analysis of temporal patterns.

## 3. Initial Analysis
Analyze the time series data for trends and seasonality. Identify the presence of a downward trend and seasonality patterns. Also, observe how the level of the data changes with time.

## 4. Decomposition
Decompose the time series data into its trend, seasonal, and residual components to better understand the underlying patterns.

## 5. Train-Test Split
Divide the time series data into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

## 6. Using Exponential Smoothing with Custom Parameters
Apply exponential smoothing techniques to the time series data with custom parameters to capture and model the trends and seasonality.

## 7. Model Performance
Evaluate the performance of the exponential smoothing model on the test dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## 8. Seasonal ARIMA Model
Implement a Seasonal ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to capture the complex patterns of the time series data.

## 9. Dickey Fuller Test for Stationarity
Perform the Dickey Fuller test to check for the stationarity of the time series data, a prerequisite for time series modeling.

## 10. First Order Diff for Detrending and Seasonal Diff for Removing Seasonality
Apply first-order differencing to detrend the time series data and seasonal differencing to remove the seasonality component.

## 11. Getting Optimal P, D, Q Values using PACF and ACF Plots
Utilize Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF) and AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) plots to identify the optimal values of the parameters P, D, and Q for the Seasonal ARIMA model.

## 12. Model Building and Parameter Tuning
Build the Seasonal ARIMA model with the determined optimal parameters. Fine-tune the model parameters for optimal performance.
